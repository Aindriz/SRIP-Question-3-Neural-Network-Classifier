# SRIP-Question-3-Neural-Network-Classifier
Implementing 2 hidden layers of neural network classifiers using JAX Library. In the above code snippet, we have incorporated a hidden layer of neural network classifier and manually optimised the number of neurons in hidden layers. MNIST dataset has been used for train:test split.
